				What are your goals in life? To answer this question you can think about
				the important roles you fulfill in your life, imagine a beautiful future
				in which you excel in these roles, and write down a mission statement
				for each one to inspire yourself!
				<br />
				<br />
				Every todo in Starfocus can be assigned to a role and you can quickly
				filter everything you see in the app to a particular role when you are
				focusing on that particular area of your life.
				<br />
				<br />
				Roles are also good frames of reference when you are reflecting on your
				progress and we'll surface stats to help you with this. Maybe you've
				gathered a lot of star points in the software creator role but not so
				many in the friend role? Time to re-prioritise!
				<br />
				<br />
				You don't have to write your mission statements right now, but deciding
				on the roles is the first step in your Starfocus journey and we'd like
				you to start it right now!
				<br />
				<br />
				We'll even generate a completely unique constellation from your roles
				and a unique URL to add to your bios.
