				When a todo is completed it stays on the screen and becomes a part of
				the log which is a record of everything you've done.

				As you use Starfocus you are building a giant list of your past,
				present, and future todos that you can simply scroll through and look
				at.
				<br />
				<br />
				This is useful when you're asking yourself “what did I do yesterday”?
